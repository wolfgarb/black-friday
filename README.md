## Installation

_This project requires Node.js and other dependencies_

- [How to install Node](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

- [MySQL docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/)

After you have installed Node, navigate to the directory you would like to use using the CLI and then clone this repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:wolfgarb/black-friday.git
```

Open VS code and use these commands to get you started:

```bash
npm install mysql2 dotenv express sequelize
npm init
```

Make sure your `package.json` includes the seed in your scripts:

```js
"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node server.js",
    "seed": "node seeds/index.js"
}
```

Start the application from the command line:

```bash
node server
```
